Atomic habits by "james clear"
get epic shit done by "ankur warikoo"
dont believe in everything by "joseph n guyen"
do it today by "darius foroix"

Difficulty is what wakes up the genius
those who commit to nothing are distracted by everything
failure is when you accept it, otherwise it's just an obstacle
We suffer more in imagination than in reality
