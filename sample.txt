Difficulty is what wakes up the genius
those who commit to nothing are distracted by everything
failure is when you accept it, otherwise it's just an obstacle
We suffer more in imagination than in reality
fear is temporary, regrets lasts forever - take the shot
i can't afford to giveup and i don't have backup - because I am the backup
without commitment you will never start, with consistency you will never finish
